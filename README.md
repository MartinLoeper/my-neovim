# my-neovim

This repsitory contains my neovim config and all tools required to run it such as lsps and formatters.
It is shipped as a home manager config. Thus, I can install it into devcontainers using dotfiles and devbox.
TBD: install steps

This config is also installed into my NixOS. No code duplication. :)
